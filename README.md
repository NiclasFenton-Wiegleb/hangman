# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The file milestone_2.py contains code that randomly picks a word from a given list. The user is then asked to guess a single letter. The code also validates that the length of the input is 1 and that it is alphabetical.
